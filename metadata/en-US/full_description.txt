GrepShot helps you find screenshots using the text within screenshots using OCR(Optical Character Recognition).

* Process images in the background
* search screenshots instantly
* export and import OCR data as json

It will take a few minutes to do OCR processing for all your screenshots on first launch, after that it will only process new screenshots the next time you open.
